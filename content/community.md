### Slack

The Kubernetes community [hangs out on Slack](http://slack.k8s.io/) at [slack.k8s.io](http://slack.k8s.io/) so we have rooms there to chat about all things Jenkins X:

* [\#jenkins-x-user](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C9MBGQJRH) for users of Jenkins X
* [\#jenkins-x-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C9LTHT2BB) for developers of Jenkins X
