First you will need to [get the jx command line tool](install) locally on your machine.

You can use the [jx command line](/commands/jx/#jx) to [create a new kubernetes cluster](create-cluster) with Jenkins X  installed automatically.

If you already have an existing kubernetes cluster then [install Jenkins X on your kubernetes cluster](install-on-cluster)

When you have a kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X installed, check out [your next steps](/getting-started/next/)
